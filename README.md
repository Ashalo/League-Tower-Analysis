# League of Legends Snowball Effect
Data science and analysis project for DSC 80 at UCSD  

## Introduction  
In League of Legends, the primary objective is to destroy the Nexus, which is the only win condition. However, for a team to reach their opponent's Nexus, they must first destroy and get past their opponent's turrets, or towers. Each team has eleven towers on each side, which are spread out along the three lanes. Not all towers need to be destroyed to reach the nexus, just all in one lane. Towers are also an indicator of how successful a team is in a certain match.  
The dataset we used was provided by [Oracle's Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads), and we focused on the 2023 season statistics, as it was the most recent complete dataset. We wanted to use this data to answer the question: **Does getting the first towers improve the chance of a team winning?**
